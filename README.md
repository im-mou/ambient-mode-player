# Youtube ambient mode

Explanation TBD

# Contubuting
### Stuff that would be nice to have:

- Option to change frames buffer count.
- Preload next thumbnails sheet a couple of seconds earlier.
- Have a backend with the option to upload videos and generate thumbnails sheets (free service).
- Refactor to decouple logic.
- Mesure performance (?).

Everyone is welcome to contribute!
